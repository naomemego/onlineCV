        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>I am currently on my 6th semester in university, majoring in both accounting and information systems. I’ve always been interested in designing and art, but have just recently started becoming more interested in systems design due to my major. I enjoy solving problems and usually won’t stop trying to figure out a solution until I successfully do so. I tend to have a lot of questions due to my nature of being curious and also because I try to minimize the mistake that I might be making. However, mistakes won’t stop me from trying to be better.</p>
